# PreVideo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
Every line of code must be readable, maintainable, and follow established patterns.
Code must be self-documenting through clear naming, with comments only for complex
algorithms or business logic rationale. All code must pass linting and static
analysis checks before being considered complete. Refactoring for clarity takes
precedence over premature optimization.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
Every feature starts with failing tests that define expected behavior. Test coverage
must exceed 80% for new code, with critical paths at 100%. Tests serve as living
documentation and must be readable examples of component usage.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing interfaces must follow established design patterns and interaction
models. Error messages must be actionable and user-friendly. Response times must
be predictable and consistent. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are mandatory,
not optional. Features must work identically across all supported platforms.

### IV. Performance by Design
Performance targets must be defined before implementation. Every feature must meet:
response time under 200ms (p95), memory footprint growth under 10% per feature,
startup time under 2 seconds. Performance regression tests are required for all
critical paths. Optimization must be measurement-driven, not assumption-based.

### V. Security as Foundation
Security cannot be an afterthought. All inputs must be validated and sanitized.
Authentication and authorization must follow OWASP guidelines. Sensitive data must
be encrypted at rest and in transit. Security reviews are mandatory for any code
handling user data or external inputs. Dependencies must be regularly audited for
vulnerabilities.

### VI. Documentation Standards
Documentation must be created alongside code, not after. API documentation must
include examples and edge cases. Architecture decisions must be recorded with
context and rationale. Setup instructions must be tested on clean environments.
Documentation must be versioned with the code it describes.

### VII. Continuous Integration
All code must build and pass tests in CI before merge. Automated checks include:
linting, type checking, unit tests, integration tests, security scanning. Build
artifacts must be reproducible. Deployment must be automated with rollback
capability. Feature flags enable safe incremental releases.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
- Every change requires review by at least one team member
- Reviews must verify: adherence to principles, test coverage, documentation
- Complex changes require architecture review before implementation
- Security-sensitive changes require security team review

### Quality Gates
- Pre-commit: Linting, formatting, basic tests
- Pre-merge: Full test suite, coverage check, security scan
- Pre-deploy: Performance tests, integration tests, smoke tests
- Post-deploy: Health checks, metric validation, error rate monitoring

### Incident Response
- Production issues take precedence over new development
- Post-mortems required for all severity 1-2 incidents
- Blameless culture focuses on system improvements
- Runbooks must be updated based on incident learnings

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Targets
- API endpoints: <200ms p95, <500ms p99
- Page loads: <3s on 3G networks
- Database queries: <50ms p95
- Background jobs: Must show progress within 1s

### Resource Constraints
- Memory usage: <500MB baseline, <1GB peak
- CPU usage: <50% average, <80% peak
- Network bandwidth: <1MB per user session
- Storage growth: <100MB per 1000 users

### Scalability Requirements
- Horizontal scaling must be supported
- Stateless design for all services
- Cache-first architecture for read-heavy operations
- Database connections pooled and limited

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution changes require:
1. Proposal with rationale and impact assessment
2. Team discussion with documented concerns
3. Majority approval from technical leads
4. Migration plan for existing code
5. Update to all affected documentation

### Compliance Verification
- Quarterly constitution compliance audits
- All PRs must include constitution checklist
- Violations must be justified and documented
- Repeated violations trigger process review

### Version Management
- MAJOR: Removal or fundamental change to principles
- MINOR: Addition of new principles or sections
- PATCH: Clarifications and minor adjustments
